# D3plus DataUSA Workshop

This repository shows how to write D3plus visualizations using the DataUSA API. It starts with basic D3plus examples, and then moves into more complex data calls utilizing real-world data.

Download this directory as a zip OR if you have git installed locally, clone the repository:

```bash
cd /repositories/directory/
git clone https://github.com/davelandry/d3plus_datausa_workshop.git d3plus_datausa_workshop
cd d3plus_datausa_workshop
```

In the same directory that you downloaded or cloned this repository run a local web server. For Mac OS X users python is preinstalled and probably your easiest option. For Windows users, you should first download python. From a terminal enter the following commands to run a python web server:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now, in your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000/. You should see a splash page containing links to each of the workshop topics. This is found in `index.html` of the root directory. Open the directory in a text editor of your choice and follow the links on the index page sequentially, programming the questions asked in the comments of each page.

If you get stuck you can always sneak a peek at the solutions, which are in this same repository under a different branch: https://github.com/davelandry/d3plus_datausa_workshop/tree/solutions
